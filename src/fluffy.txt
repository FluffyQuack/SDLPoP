Progress trying to make this build:
- Added two BATs for compiling
- Start a command prompt instance in this directory
- Run fluffy-build-step1.bat
- Run fluffy-build-step2.bat (add debug or release as argument)

Edits required:
- Edited two lines in build.bat to be like this:

set CommonCompilerFlags= /nologo /MP /fp:fast /GR- /wd4048 %PreprocessorDefinitions% /I"%SDL2%\include\SDL2" /I"%SDL2_Image%\include\SDL2"
set CommonLinkerFlags= /subsystem:windows,5.01 /libpath:"%SDL2%\lib\" /libpath:"%SDL2_Image%\lib\" /libpath:"%SDL2%\lib\manual-link\" Shell32.lib SDL2main.lib SDL2.lib SDL2_image.lib icon.res /out:..\prince.exe

- Edited seg000.c to included these lines to fix a compile error:

//Fluffy: Added this since we got compile error due to missing M_PI
#ifndef M_PI
	#define M_PI  3.14159265358979323846264f  // from CRC
#endif

- Commented out the code calling SetProcessDPIAware() in seg009.c to fix a compilation error

- Renamed the "wstat()" call to "_wstat()" in seg009.c

- Maybe it would be possible to create a visual studio project?
